# G :)

The Program was in use during the final stage of the Project Grindstone G arc, which took place over the course of a few weeks and made use of the PG minecraft server.

This Program would:
- Only run once, through the use of file creation. 
- Open a terminal with only the neccesary permissions to output text, then output the following:

```Downloading...```

then

```Uploading...```

then finally 

```Thank you``` Formatted to go diagonally across the terminal

This would be ended off with a number of smiley's `:)` at which point the program would close.

Disclaimer: Although the program says it's `Downloading` or `Uploading`,  in reality the program never attempts to make any sort of connection to the internet.
